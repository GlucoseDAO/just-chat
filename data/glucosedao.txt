GlucoseDAO is an innovative decentralized science project focused on glucose prediction and health optimization,
combining technology with community-driven healthcare solutions.

Project Overview
Core Mission
The project aims to develop an open-source glucose prediction system while building a collaborative community
focused on health and longevity. The initiative addresses a significant market, with 6.7% of the global population 
being diabetic and approximately one-third interested in health awareness and lifestyle improvement.

Technical Development
-Created an open-source glucose prediction repository using an open-source transformer model
-Launched a microstudy collecting CGM and movement data(still in progress)
-Developing a human prediction benchmark game (since there is no golden standard for glucose prediction)
-Maintaining public Huggingface models and datasets

Achievements and Recognition
-Secured aprox $2,000 funding from DesciFunding GG21 (here is the link for the pitch "https://glucosedao.github.io/")
-Presented research at ARDD 2024 as a figure in a poster
-Conducted presentations at Zelar and HEALES longevity meetings

Market Analysis
Current Market Status
-Proprietary CGM apps average 2.5-star ratings
-Third-party apps with better user data access achieve 4.5-star ratings
-Existing solutions primarily focus on direct value readings without predictive capabilities

Leadership Structure
Core Team
-Founder: Zaharia Livia (Type 1 diabetic)
-Founding Members: Anton Kulaga, Brandon Houten
Scientific Advisory Board
-Irina Gaianova (University of Michigan, Biostatistics)

The decentralized approach aims to accelerate discovery in health optimization through community-driven funding and open-access platforms.






How does GlucoseDao plan to improve glucose prediction accuracy?
GlucoseDAO's approach to improving glucose prediction accuracy involves a combination of 
data collection and benchmarking strategies:

Data Collection Approach (resulting in a larger and more diverse dataset)
-microstudy that combines Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data with movement data to build comprehensive prediction models.
-users can contribute their data to the dataset
-researchers can use the dataset to train their models or to test new models/theories

Benchmarking Strategy
-The project is developing a unique benchmarking method through a game where users predict glucose value changes 
-for the next hour. This human prediction rate will serve as a baseline to validate their model's effectiveness.

Technical Implementation
-Created an open-source project available on GitHub
-Focuses on data integration capabilities for users
-Maintains open datasets for collaborative improvement

This approach is scientifically sound, as research has shown that for 30-minute prediction horizons, well-designed models 
can achieve 95.8-99.7% clinically acceptable predictions1. The inclusion of additional physiological data, particularly 
during physical activity, has been proven to significantly improve prediction accuracy. (see "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6610614/")





What specific technologies will GlucoseDao use to enhance glucose prediction accuracy?
-Multi-Source Data Integration
-Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) as the primary data source
-Smartwatch sensor data including heart rate and step detection1
-Accelerometry data for physical activity tracking
-Machine Learning Architecture

Performance Metrics
This technical approach could achieve:
-15-minute predictions with RMSE of 0.19mmol/L and 99% clinical safety
-60-minute predictions with RMSE of 0.59mmol/L and 98% clinical safety
(see "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8224858/")

-Improved accuracy by removing reliance on manual activity logging
(see "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11257318/")

Real-time Processing
The system would implement:
-Edge computing for real-time model inference
-Continuous data collection and processing from wearable devices
-Automated activity monitoring to replace manual documentation





What are the main goals of the GlucoseDao community?
GlucoseDAO has three primary goals focused on democratizing glucose data and prediction:

Data Collection and Sharing
-Establish a decentralized open database of blood glucose values from CGM devices
-Collect volunteer-contributed data including health and lifestyle variables
-Address the current limitation of existing datasets which only include dozens of people monitored for short periods

Technical Development
-Train and fine-tune models to predict blood glucose trends
-Contribute models and datasets to the GlucoBench benchmark
-Create user-friendly implementations of prediction models for everyday use

Community Governance
-Establish a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to govern data collection and development
-Develop protocols for sharing glucose data
-Implement smart contracts to reward participants when their data is used in commercial applications

The project aims to benefit both people with medical conditions and health-conscious individuals interested in optimizing their longevity through better glucose 
management






How does the GlucoseDao project benefit from being open source?

Community Engagement
-Increased visibility in the developer community leads to more potential contributors and users
-Bug fixes and improvements can come from anyone with the skills and motivation
-Community members can suggest new features and participate in development decisions

Technical Advantages
-Larger pool of testers helps identify and fix issues more quickly
-Enhanced security through code transparency and community oversight
-Potential for community-driven bug fixes and patches that wouldn't be available in closed-source projects

Trust and Sustainability
-Promotes transparency in data collection and research collaboration
-Provides business continuity assurance for users and stakeholders
-Allows for fair profit-sharing through smart contracts when data is used commercially

Research Impact
-Facilitates collaborative research while maintaining contributor privacy
-Enables contribution to broader scientific benchmarks like GlucoBench
-Supports the democratization of valuable health data and insights

How does GlucoseDao ensure the portability of their predictive models across different individuals?

Data Standardization
-Implement data normalization across different CGM devices and measurement units
-Create standardized formats for auxiliary data like movement and lifestyle factors
-Use semantic web resources and ontologies to maintain consistent data interpretation

Model Architecture
-Develop transfer learning approaches to adapt base models to individual characteristics
-Include personalization layers that can be fine-tuned for each user
-Create a hierarchical structure that captures both population-level and individual patterns

Validation Framework
-Set specific thresholds for acceptable accuracy loss during model transfer
-Evaluate model performance across diverse user groups
-Test models across different glucose monitoring devices and conditions
