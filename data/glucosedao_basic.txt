GlucoseDAO is an innovative decentralized science project focused on glucose prediction and health optimization,
combining technology with community-driven healthcare solutions.

Project Overview
Core Mission
The project aims to develop an open-source glucose prediction system while building a collaborative community
focused on health and longevity. The initiative addresses a significant market, with 6.7% of the global population 
being diabetic and approximately one-third interested in health awareness and lifestyle improvement.

Technical Development
-Created an open-source glucose prediction repository using an open-source transformer model
-Launched a microstudy collecting CGM and movement data(still in progress)
-Developing a human prediction benchmark game (since there is no golden standard for glucose prediction)
-Maintaining public Huggingface models and datasets

Achievements and Recognition
-Secured aprox $2,000 funding from DesciFunding GG21 (here is the link for the pitch "https://glucosedao.github.io/")
-Presented research at ARDD 2024 as a figure in a poster
-Conducted presentations at Zelar and HEALES longevity meetings

Market Analysis
Current Market Status
-Proprietary CGM apps average 2.5-star ratings
-Third-party apps with better user data access achieve 4.5-star ratings
-Existing solutions primarily focus on direct value readings without predictive capabilities

Leadership Structure
Core Team
-Founder: Zaharia Livia (Type 1 diabetic)
-Founding Members: Anton Kulaga, Brandon Houten
Scientific Advisory Board
-Irina Gaianova (University of Michigan, Biostatistics)
-Prof. Georg Fullen (Rostock University)
-Renat Sergazinov (GlucoBench author)

Future Development
The project is actively seeking additional funding and community participation to expand its scope and capabilities.
The decentralized approach aims to accelerate discovery in health optimization through community-driven funding and open-access platforms.
